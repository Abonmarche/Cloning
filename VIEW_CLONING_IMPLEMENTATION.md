# View and Join View Cloning Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds support for cloning ArcGIS Online View Layers and Join View Layers, which are special types of feature services that reference other hosted feature layers.

## Key Challenges Addressed

### 1. Type Detection
- Views and Join Views appear as "Feature Service" items in ArcGIS Online
- Regular feature layers don't have an `isView` property - only views have it (and it's `true`)
- Join views require checking the admin REST API endpoint to detect join definitions

### 2. Implementation Details

#### ViewCloner (`solution_cloner/cloners/view_cloner.py`)
- Handles standard view layers that filter or subset parent feature layers
- Preserves field visibility settings using ViewManager API
- Tracks which layers/tables from the parent are included in the view
- Updates references to parent layers if they've been cloned

Key features:
- Extracts view configuration including visible fields, queries, and layer subsets
- Uses `create_view()` method from parent FeatureLayerCollection
- Applies field visibility after creation using ViewManager
- Tracks service and sublayer URLs for ID mapping

#### JoinViewCloner (`solution_cloner/cloners/join_view_cloner.py`)
- Handles join views that combine data from two feature layers
- Uses admin REST API endpoint to extract join definitions
- Preserves join types (INNER, LEFT, etc.) and cardinality (1:1, 1:many)
- Updates references to source layers if they've been cloned

Key features:
- Queries `/rest/admin/services/` endpoint for complete join definition
- Extracts parent/child key fields and join parameters
- Creates empty view service then applies join definition
- Supports both one-to-one (with topFilter) and one-to-many joins

### 3. Solution Cloner Integration

Updated `solution_cloner.py` with:
- `_detect_feature_service_subtype()` method to differentiate feature services
- `get_cloner_for_item()` method that performs type detection
- Automatic detection when processing Feature Service items

Detection flow:
1. Check if item has `isView=true` property
2. If it's a view, check admin endpoint for join definition
3. Route to appropriate cloner (FeatureLayerCloner, ViewCloner, or JoinViewCloner)

## Usage

### Cloning a View Layer
```python
view_cloner = ViewCloner()
new_view = view_cloner.clone(
    source_item={'id': 'view_id', 'type': 'Feature Service'},
    source_gis=gis,
    dest_gis=gis,
    dest_folder='folder',
    id_mapping={'ids': {'parent_id': 'new_parent_id'}}
)
```

### Cloning a Join View
```python
join_cloner = JoinViewCloner()
new_join = join_cloner.clone(
    source_item={'id': 'join_view_id', 'type': 'Feature Service'},
    source_gis=gis,
    dest_gis=gis,
    dest_folder='folder',
    id_mapping={'ids': {'source1_id': 'new_source1_id', 'source2_id': 'new_source2_id'}}
)
```

### Automatic Detection in Solution Cloner
The solution cloner automatically detects and routes to the correct cloner:
```python
cloner = SolutionCloner()
# Automatically detects views and join views during cloning
cloner.clone_solution()
```

## Testing

Use `test_view_cloning.py` to verify:
- View detection (regular vs view vs join view)
- View cloning with field visibility
- Join view cloning with join definitions
- Solution cloner integration

Test credentials are included in the script (from `recreate_Views_by_json.py`).

## Important Notes

1. **Admin Access**: Join view detection requires admin REST API access. The user must have appropriate privileges.

2. **Parent Dependencies**: Views depend on their parent feature layers. The system will:
   - Use cloned parent if available in ID mapping
   - Fall back to original parent if not yet cloned
   - Best practice: ensure parents are cloned before views

3. **Field Visibility**: View field visibility is applied after creation using the ViewManager API, which may require a few retries as the view initializes.

4. **URL Tracking**: Both cloners track service and sublayer URLs for proper reference mapping in dependent items like web maps.

## Clone Order

Following the hierarchy:
1. Feature Layers (base data)
2. Views (depend on feature layers)
3. Join Views (depend on multiple feature layers)
4. Web Maps (may reference any of the above)
5. Apps/Dashboards (depend on maps and layers)
